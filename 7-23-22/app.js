/* Chef's son Chefu found some matches in the kitchen and he immediately starting playing with them.

The first thing Chefu wanted to do was to calculate the result of his homework â€”
 the sum of AA and BB, and write it using matches. Help Chefu and tell him the number of matches needed to write the result.

 p:gicen two numbers to add together
 r:return the amount of matches it will take to make the number that the sum is
 e:
 3
