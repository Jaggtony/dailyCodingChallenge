const subt = (x, y)=>alert(x-y)

//create a function that divides three numbers and console logs the quotient
const threeDiv = (x, y, z ) =>console.log(x/y/z)
//create a function that multiplys three numbers and returns the product

//---Medium
//create a function that takes in three numbers. Add the first two numbers and return the remainder of dividing the sum of the first two numbers by the third number
